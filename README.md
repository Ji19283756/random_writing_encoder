# random_writing_encoder
Im not going to lie this code is pretty useless, thought i suppose its obscurity could actually be what makes it "secure". (Dont use this to encode anything important). Anyways when I wrote my "writing diagonally" program i thought that it could have no possible use, but after thinking about it I decided that useless programs can make useless solutions. You see when you read a message that's written diagonally in the traditional left to right way, you get absolute nonsense. This made me think "hey what if we just did that A LOT and reading and writing text from every possible direction?". 34 functions later and i got a program to do just that. The program contains an encoder and a decoder and can produce a key and an order of encoding, which basically tells the order that the message was scrambled. The option switches tells the program how many times to read and write the message, a higher number (if im correct) leads to better scrabble though the it might take longer. Anyways if you somehow find this code, I hope you actually use it!
